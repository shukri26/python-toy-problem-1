Code 2 - Consonant Value:
This code defines a function consonant_value that takes a string and removes the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and then splits the string to create groups of consonant sequences. It calculates the value of each group by summing the position of each character in the alphabet plus one. The function returns the maximum value among these calculated values for each group of consonants. The code demonstrates the function by calling it with the input string "strength" and printing the result.

Code 3 - Two Positive Numbers:
This code defines a function two_numbers_are_positive that checks whether exactly two out of three given numbers are positive. It iterates through the provided numbers and counts the positive ones. If exactly two numbers are positive, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The code demonstrates the function by calling it with the input numbers (14, -3, -4) and printing the result.
